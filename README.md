## How to use - Text

If you’ve ever found yourself needing to merge or split PDF documents, you’ve probably considered using Adobe Acrobat. While it’s a powerful tool, its cost can be a major drawback for individuals and small businesses, especially now that it requires a monthly subscription. Luckily, there is an affordable alternative, Star PDF Solution, that can handle these tasks with ease and does not require a monthly subscription. A one time payment of $5 will unlock combining and splitting PDFs for a lifetime or for entire company with unlimited users for $100.


In this post, we will go over all the features of Star PDF Solution, including being able to combine / split PDFs from file explorer and options to remove comments and bookmarks during the process.

### Combining PDFs
Merging PDF documents can be done in as few as 2-3 clicks using the file explorer context menu options or dropping files directly into the program. Outside of quickly combing PDFs there are options to reorder the documents before combining and options to effect what happens during and after the documents are combined (removing comments, deleting source files, etc.).

### Quick Combine from File Explorer
The quickest way to combine a set of PDFs would be to use the File Explorer context menu options by selecting any number of PDF documents and right clicking them (please note you may need to click "More Options" if you are using Windows 11).

File Explorer
1.	Select the PDFs you want to combine
2.	Right click (if you are on Windows 11 you may need to click "More Options as well)
3.	Select "Combine PDF"
4.	Star PDF will open and automatically combine the selected documents

#### Step 2 - Ordering
Sometimes you need to have the documents in a specific order before combining them. You can change the order in which the PDFs will be combined by using the up and own arrow buttons. By default, documents are sorted naturally (the same sort method file explorer uses). When using the up and down arrow buttons natural sort will be disabled automatically (this indicated by a red diagonal line over the button.

To manually sort the documents follow the directions below.

1. Select a document
2. Click the up or down arrow button to move the selected document one position down or up

#### Natural Sorting
By default natural sort is enabled and this will order the documents the same way file explorer sorts its documents. Natural sorting can be toggled off and on using the two up down triangle button or by using the the up and down arrows to manually move documents in a different order.

Natural Sort is On

Step 3 - Review Options


There are a handful of helpful options to give more control on what happens after the PDFs are combined or during the process of combining. The options menu is collapsed by default, click on it to expand it.

1. Remove Comments - will remove any comments from the source files
2. Remove Bookmarks - will prevent any bookmarks from being copied to the combined PDF
3. Open Combined File - will open the resulting combined PDF after its been created
4. Delete Source Files - will try to delete any files used to create the combined PDF (will fail if the file is open by another process)
